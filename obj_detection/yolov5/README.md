Borrowing the models provided at https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 , we performed several fine-tuning experiments, summarized in the [pdf report](../../report.pdf). All the details of the experiments referenced in the report, and additional visualization graphs, can be found in the folder `runs/train/` and `runs/detect/`, respectively for fine-tuning and inferences tasks.
