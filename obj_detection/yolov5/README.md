Borrowing the models provided at https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 , we performed several fine-tuning experiments on YOLOv5, leveraging the dedicated fine-tuning API.

The experiments conducted are summarized in the [pdf report](../../report.pdf) and the details of each experiment referenced in the report, as well as additional visualization graphs, can be found in the folder `runs/train/` and `runs/detect/`, respectively for fine-tuning and corresponding inferences tasks.
