Borrowing this repo from https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 , we have used YOLOv5 to perform a set of experiments of finetuning, with the goal of evaluating the impact of different dehazing techniques on object detection tasks.


All the experiments of finetunine were automatically placed in `runs/train/` ,while the inferences results are located in 'runs/test`. A description of the most relevant subset of this experiments is provided
