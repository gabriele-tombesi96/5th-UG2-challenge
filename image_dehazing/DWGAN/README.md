Borrowing this repo from https://github.com/liuh127/NTIRE-2021-Dehazing-DWGAN , we have performed several inferences experiments to augment our datasets for object detection. More details on the functions used to port A2I2 iamge formats to DWGAN and vice-versa can be found in `im_preproc/`, while a short description of the different images sets used for inferences and the corresponding results are respectively located at `input_set/` and `outputs/`
